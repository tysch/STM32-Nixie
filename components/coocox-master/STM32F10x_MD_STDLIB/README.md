# STM32F10x_MD_STDLIB 
The STM32F10x Standard Peripherals Library is a complete package, consisting of device drivers for all of the standard device peripherals, for STM32 Value line(High, Medium and Low), Connectivity line, XL-, High-, Medium- and Low- Density Devices 32-bit Flash microcontrollers.

This library is a firmware package which contains a collection of routines, data structures and macros covering the features of STM32 peripherals. It includes a description of the device drivers plus a set of examples for each peripheral. The firmware library allows any device to be used in the user application without the need for in-depth study of each peripheralâ€™s specifications.

Using the Standard Peripherals Library has two advantages: it saves significant time that would otherwise be spent in coding, while simultaneously reducing application development and integration costs.

The STM32F10x Standard Peripherals Library is full CMSIS compliant.
